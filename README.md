# Plex Scripts

A collection of Python scripts designed to interact with [Plex Media Server](https://www.plex.tv/) in various ways. Each script is housed in its own subdirectory, with a dedicated `README` that provides detailed instructions on usage, requirements, and configuration for that particular script.

## Contents

Within this folder, you'll find subfolders, each corresponding to a different script or tool. Some examples of what you might find here include:

- **Episode-Renamer Scripts**: Tools for renaming TV show episodes based on media filenames or other patterns.
- **Metadata-Updater Scripts**: Utilities for updating Plex metadata, such as episode descriptions, posters, or titles.
- **Automated Tasks**: Scripts that might run periodically to maintain your Plex library.

## How to Use

1. **Explore Each Subfolder**  
   Each subfolder contains a script and its own `README.md`. Please refer to that `README` for specific setup instructions, dependencies, and usage details.

2. **Ensure Dependencies Are Met**  
   Many scripts here utilize [**plexapi**](https://pypi.org/project/plexapi/) and potentially other libraries. Check each script’s documentation to see which dependencies are required.

3. **Run the Scripts**  
   Depending on the script:
   - You may need to set up environment variables (or a configuration file).
   - You may need Python 3.6+ (or another version specified in the script’s `README`).
   - Follow the instructions in each script’s `README` to install and run.
